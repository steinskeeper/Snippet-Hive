# Snippet Hive


Snippet Hive will provide a platform for programmers to create and share code snippets
with each other. With Data Analytics applied onto the snippets, the platform will be able
to rank the importance of each snippet and recommend it to a person who would find it
useful in a particular context. Using Machine Learning the platform will learn as snippets
are created and shared to give better snippet suggestions

## Problem Statement

It is an often occurrence for programmers to go in search of a particular code snippet
that could solve a bug or teach them new ways of doing things. But the resources are all
scattered around the internet in the form of documentations, forums and blog posts
which makes the process of learning hard and time consuming. Therefore there is a need
for a platform that aggregates all the snippets and suggests it based on a
recommendation system so programmers can find exactly what they are looking for
when they actually need it.
